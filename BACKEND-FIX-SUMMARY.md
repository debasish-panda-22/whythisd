# Backend Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The backend was stuck in "Waiting" state because:

1. **Wrong Application Code**: The `index.js` was using a simple test app instead of the actual application
2. **Missing Dependencies**: The Dockerfile was not installing the required dependencies from `package.json`
3. **Incomplete Application**: Only `index.js` was copied to the container, but the actual application code is in the `src/` directory

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `backend/index.js`
- Changed from simple test app to import the actual application from `./src/app.js`
- Now properly serves the full hianime API with all endpoints
- Includes health check (`/ping`), test endpoint (`/test`), and API documentation (`/ui`)

### 2. Updated `backend/Dockerfile`
- Added `bun install --frozen-lockfile` to install dependencies
- Changed `COPY index.js ./` to `COPY . .` to include all source files
- Now properly builds the complete application

## How to Fix the Issue

### Option 1: Rebuild and Restart (Recommended)

```bash
# Stop current services
docker compose down

# Rebuild with the fixed code
docker compose up --build -d

# Check logs
docker compose logs -f hianime-backend
```

### Option 2: If Still Stuck, Check Logs

```bash
# Check backend logs specifically
docker compose logs hianime-backend

# Check all service logs
docker compose logs

# Check service status
docker compose ps
```

### Option 3: Complete Reset

```bash
# Stop everything
docker compose down

# Clean up
docker system prune -f

# Rebuild from scratch
docker compose up --build -d

# Monitor startup
docker compose logs -f
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Backend should start successfully** with logs showing:
   ```
   ðŸš€ Starting hianime-api backend server...
   ðŸ“¦ Loading backend dependencies...
   âœ… Environment variables loaded
   âœ… All dependencies loaded successfully
   âœ… Application initialized successfully
   âœ… Server started successfully on port 3030
   ðŸŸ¢ Server is running and ready to accept connections
   ```

2. **Health checks should pass**:
   - Backend: `http://localhost:3030/ping` should return "pong"
   - Frontend: Should become healthy after backend is ready
   - Nginx: Should become healthy after both frontend and backend are ready

3. **All endpoints should be available**:
   - API: `http://localhost:3030/api/v1`
   - Documentation: `http://localhost:3030/ui`
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Nginx: `http://localhost:8080`

## Troubleshooting

If the backend still fails to start, check for:

1. **Port conflicts**: Make sure port 3030 is available
2. **Dependency issues**: Check if all npm/bun packages install correctly
3. **Environment variables**: Verify `backend.env` has correct values
4. **File permissions**: Ensure all files are readable in the container

## Access Points After Fix

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3000/api (via nginx) or http://localhost:3030/api (direct)
- **Backend Direct**: http://localhost:3030
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:3030/ui
- **Nginx HTTP**: http://localhost:8080
- **Nginx HTTPS**: https://localhost:8443
